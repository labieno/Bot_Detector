# Bot_Detector
Detecting bots on Twitter using graphs and Machine Learning (2021) - Code

## Summary

We developed a Python module that automatically collects the data and activity of a user on Twitter and then analyse it using graph analysis and Machine Learning techniques to determine whether it is a bot or a human through the discovery of relevant patterns, anomalies, etc...

The seed of the work is the idea of developing a line of research aimed at solving problems similar to the detection of bots in a social network: those problems typical of computer networks and social networks where endpoints or users interact respectively with their peers through the possibilities offered by the network.
Several of the proposed objectives are met at the end of the work carried out, although the results are lower than expected in terms of bot discovery with supervised learning.

Due to the dimensions of the project itself, there is a considerable range of improvement and it is possible to incorporate different ideas and/or small modules to replace others applied here thanks to the modularity of the developed programme.
